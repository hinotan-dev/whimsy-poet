WhimsyPoet is a playful web app that lets kids (and grown-ups!) create whimsical poems from their own imagination. Simply enter a few keywords — like *pink sky*, *upside-down house*, or *flying popcorns* — and the app will generate a rhythmic, rhyming verse full of childlike wonder.

## ✨ Features

* 📝 Rhythm and rhyme inspired by classic children’s books like those by Dr. Seuss
* 📚 A personal poem "Library" saved in localStorage

* 💾 No login, no cloud — your poems stay safely on your device
