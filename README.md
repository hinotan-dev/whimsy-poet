## 🪄 WhimsyPoet: A Whimsical Poem Generator

**WhimsyPoet** is a playful web app that lets kids (and grown-ups!) create whimsical poems from their own imagination. Simply enter a few keywords — like *pink sky*, *upside-down house*, or *flying popcorns* — and the app will generate a rhythmic, rhyming verse full of childlike wonder.

✨ Features:

* 🎨 Keyword-based poem generation powered by AI
* 📝 Rhythm and rhyme inspired by classic children’s books like those by Dr. Seuss
* 📚 A personal poem "Library" saved in localStorage
* 📖 Clickable "book covers" showing the first letter of each poem
* 💾 No login, no cloud — your poems stay safely on your device

Built with **React** and lots of love, this project explores how technology and creativity can come together to spark joy and storytelling, one silly stanza at a time.
